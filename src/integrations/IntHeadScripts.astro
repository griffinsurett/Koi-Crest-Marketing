/**
 * Integration Head Scripts
 *
 * Consolidates all integration scripts that need to run in the <head> section.
 * These scripts run early to prevent FOUC and set up critical functionality.
 *
 * Currently includes:
 * - ConsentScript: Cookie consent initialization (must run first)
 * - AccessibilityScript: Applies saved accessibility preferences before render
 * - LanguageDetectionScript: Detects browser language early
 * - BrowserTranslateScript: Sets up translation (native + Google fallback)
