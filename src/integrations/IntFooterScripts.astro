/**
 * Integration Footer Scripts
 *
 * Consolidates all integration components that render in the footer area.
 * These are typically UI elements that appear at the bottom of the page
 * and can be lazily loaded.
 *
 * Currently includes:
 * - CookieConsentBanner: Initial consent banner (shows if no consent given)
 *
 * Note: CookiePreferencesButton and AccessibilityButton are rendered
 * directly in Footer.astro for better layout control.
