## Reach Them Before They Need You

Most homeowners don't wake up thinking about their roof. Their HVAC system. Their gutters. They don't know they need you—until they do.

Facebook and Instagram advertising lets you reach them first. Before the emergency. Before they start searching. While they're scrolling through their feed, you can be the contractor they remember when it matters.

By the time they actually need services, you're not a stranger. You're the company they've seen. The one that looks professional. The one they'll call.

## The Social Advertising Advantage

Google Ads captures existing demand. Facebook and Instagram create it.

**Precision targeting.** Reach homeowners in your exact service area. Target by neighborhood, home value, age of home, even homeowner status. No wasted spend on renters or people outside your territory.

**Visual storytelling.** Your best work, in front of the right eyes. Before-and-after photos. Drone footage. Project showcases. Social media is built for visual content—and your work is inherently visual.

**Brand building at scale.** Every impression builds familiarity. Every ad reinforces your brand. When someone needs your services, the company they've seen multiple times feels safer than a complete stranger.

**Lower competition.** Everyone fights for Google search traffic. Fewer contractors have cracked Facebook advertising. The opportunity is less crowded, and often more affordable.

## Plant Seeds, Harvest Leads

Social advertising is about planting seeds. Every impression is a seed of awareness. Some sprout immediately—direct leads from your ads. Others grow over time—people who remember you months later when they need help.

The contractors winning in 2024 aren't just capturing demand. They're creating it.
