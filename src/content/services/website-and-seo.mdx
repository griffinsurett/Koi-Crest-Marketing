## Your Website Is Working Against You

Right now, someone in your service area just searched for exactly what you do. They typed in "roofer near me" or "best HVAC company in [your city]." They looked at the search results, picked a company, and called them.

It probably wasn't you.

If your website is slow, outdated, or invisible on Google, you're not just missing opportunities—you're handing them to competitors. Every day your website underperforms is another day of leads going elsewhere.

## The Digital Foundation Problem

Most contractor websites fail for the same reasons:

**They're invisible.** A website nobody can find is a website that generates no business. If you're not ranking on page one of Google for your services in your area, you might as well not exist online.

**They're slow.** Modern customers expect websites to load in under 3 seconds. Every second beyond that costs you 7% of conversions. Many contractor websites take 8-10 seconds to load on mobile. Do the math.

**They don't convert.** Traffic means nothing without action. Visitors need clear paths to contact you—phone numbers that are easy to tap, forms that are simple to complete, chat options for quick questions.

**They're not mobile-ready.** Over 60% of searches happen on phones. If your site doesn't work flawlessly on mobile, you're losing most of your potential customers before they even see your services.

## Building Your Digital Headquarters

We build websites specifically for home service contractors—not generic templates, but strategic digital properties designed to rank, convert, and grow your business.

**Lightning-fast performance.** Our sites load in under 2 seconds. We achieve this through modern development practices, optimized images, and premium hosting infrastructure. Speed isn't a feature—it's a requirement.

**Local SEO built in.** Every website we build is structured for search engine success. Schema markup, local business optimization, Google Business Profile integration—the technical foundation that gets you ranking.

**Conversion-focused design.** Clear calls to action, mobile-optimized layouts, trust signals in the right places. Every element serves one purpose: turning visitors into leads.

**Growth-ready architecture.** Your website should grow with your business. We build on modern foundations that scale—easy to update, simple to expand, built to last.

## The Center of Everything

Your website isn't just another marketing expense. It's the center of your entire digital presence. Your ads drive traffic there. Your social media links back to it. Your Google Business Profile connects to it. Your reputation is built on it.

When the center is strong, everything else works better. When it's weak, everything else struggles.
