## The Expensive Mistake

You needed project management software. You researched options, read reviews, picked one that seemed right. Six months later, nobody uses it. Thousands of dollars wasted. You're back to spreadsheets and email.

Or worse: you're locked into the wrong system. Switching costs are prohibitive. Every workaround creates more workarounds. The tool that was supposed to solve problems creates them.

Software decisions have long-term consequences. The right choice compounds value for years. The wrong choice compounds frustration.

## Why Software Decisions Go Wrong

With thousands of software options for every business need, making good choices requires more than reading feature lists. Understanding common mistakes helps avoid them.

**Features over fit.** Choosing software with the most capabilities instead of the right capabilities. Complex tools for simple needs. Enterprise solutions for small teams.

**Ignoring integration.** Software that doesn't connect to existing systems. Data silos that create extra work. Islands of information that should flow together.

**Underestimating implementation.** Buying software without planning adoption. Tools that require configuration, training, and process change—treated as plug-and-play.

**Vendor lock-in blindness.** Choosing proprietary platforms without understanding long-term implications. Data formats that trap you. Pricing that increases after you're dependent.

## Strategic Software Guidance

We help businesses make software decisions that serve long-term interests—selecting the right tools and implementing them properly.

**Needs assessment.** Understanding what you actually need before looking at solutions. Requirements that drive selection, not vendor marketing.

**Solution evaluation.** Systematic comparison of options against your specific criteria. Demo facilitation. Reference checks. Due diligence that prevents expensive mistakes.

**Implementation planning.** Roadmaps that account for data migration, integration, training, and adoption. Realistic timelines and resource requirements.

**Vendor management.** Contract review. Negotiation support. Ongoing relationship management that protects your interests.

## Decisions That Compound

The right software, properly implemented, multiplies productivity for years. The wrong software, poorly implemented, drains resources for years. The difference often comes down to decisions made before purchase.

Expert guidance on software decisions isn't expense—it's insurance against expensive mistakes.
