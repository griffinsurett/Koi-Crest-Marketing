## The Physical Difference

In a world of infinite digital scroll, print stands out by standing still. It occupies physical space. It demands attention differently. It can't be swiped away or blocked by an ad blocker.

Print isn't dead—it's evolved. The mailbox that once overflowed now holds fewer pieces. Each one gets more attention. The magazine ad that competes with three others, not thirty. The brochure that stays on a desk while browser tabs close.

For certain audiences and objectives, print still performs. Sometimes better than ever.

## Why Print Advertising Fails

Print's permanence cuts both ways. Digital mistakes disappear. Print mistakes live on coffee tables and in waiting rooms. Getting print right requires understanding its unique constraints and opportunities.

**Digital design in print format.** Layouts that work on screens but fail on paper. Ignoring print's different viewing distances, tactile qualities, and attention patterns.

**Production ignorance.** Colors that don't print as designed. Bleeds that get cut wrong. Paper choices that undermine the message. Technical failures that waste budget.

**Wrong placement, wrong audience.** Print in publications nobody reads. Direct mail to addresses that don't convert. Shotgun approaches in a medium that rewards precision.

**Isolated from integrated campaigns.** Print that doesn't connect to digital presence. No QR codes, no trackable URLs, no way to measure or extend the interaction.

## Print That Performs

We create print advertising designed for the medium—leveraging print's unique strengths while avoiding its common pitfalls.

**Publication advertising.** Magazine and newspaper ads designed for their contexts—understanding readership, placement options, and creative best practices.

**Direct mail.** Postcards, letters, and packages designed to get opened and acted upon. Not spray-and-pray mass mailings, but targeted physical communication.

**Brochures and collateral.** Leave-behinds that work—informative, persuasive, and designed for how they'll actually be used.

**Production management.** Understanding paper, printing, and finishing. Ensuring what's designed is what's produced, on budget and on time.

## Strategic Print

Print works when it's strategic—the right message, to the right audience, in the right format, at the right time. Used thoughtfully, print cuts through digital noise with something screens can't replicate: physical presence.
