## The Gap Between Marketing and Revenue

Marketing generates leads. Sales closes them. Simple in theory—chaotic in practice.

Leads come in but don't convert. Sales blames marketing for quality. Marketing blames sales for follow-up. Meanwhile, revenue stalls and neither team knows exactly why.

The problem isn't marketing or sales—it's the gap between them. Where leads go to die. Where opportunities fall through cracks. Where the promise of marketing meets the reality of conversion.

## Why Sales and Marketing Misalign

When marketing and sales operate in silos, everyone loses. Leads get wasted, customers get confused, and revenue gets left on the table.

**Different definitions of "qualified."** Marketing counts leads. Sales wants opportunities. Without shared criteria, marketing celebrates numbers that sales dismisses.

**Handoff without context.** When leads transfer from marketing to sales without context—what they read, what they clicked, what they care about—sales starts every conversation from scratch.

**No feedback loop.** Marketing can't improve what it doesn't know. When sales doesn't report back which leads convert and why, marketing keeps producing the same problems.

**Misaligned incentives.** Marketing optimized for lead volume. Sales compensated on closed deals. Neither rewarded for the collaboration that generates actual revenue.

## Bridging Marketing and Sales

We develop sales marketing programs that bridge the gap—creating alignment between lead generation and revenue conversion.

**Lead qualification frameworks.** Shared definitions of marketing qualified leads (MQLs) and sales qualified leads (SQLs) that both teams agree on. Clarity on what makes a lead worth pursuing.

**Sales enablement content.** Case studies, battle cards, proposal templates—materials that help sales close what marketing generated.

**Lead nurturing sequences.** Automated communication that keeps leads warm and educated until they're ready for sales conversation.

**CRM integration and reporting.** End-to-end visibility from first touch to closed deal. Understanding what generates revenue, not just leads.

## Revenue as the Only Metric

Leads are meaningless if they don't become customers. Marketing that doesn't generate revenue is just activity. Sales that can't close is just conversation.

The only metric that matters is revenue. Everything else is just a leading indicator—useful only insofar as it predicts what actually counts.
