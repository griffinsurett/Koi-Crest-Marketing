## They Visited. They Left. They Haven't Forgotten.

Someone found your website. They looked at your services. Checked your reviews. Maybe even started filling out your contact form.

Then they got distracted. Their phone rang. The kids needed attention. They thought "I'll do this later"—and later never came.

That visitor is still interested. They just need a reminder. Retargeting puts your business back in front of them, across the web and social media, until they're ready to take action.

## Why Retargeting Works

Most visitors don't convert on the first visit. Not because they're not interested—because life gets in the way. Retargeting solves this problem.

**The 98% problem.** Less than 2% of website visitors convert on the first visit. The other 98% leave without taking action. Retargeting reaches them again.

**Warm audience advantage.** These aren't strangers—they already know who you are. They've seen your website, your services, your reviews. The trust-building has started. Retargeting continues it.

**The consideration window.** Home services decisions often take days or weeks. Retargeting keeps you visible throughout that entire consideration process—so when they're ready to decide, you're there.

**Lower costs.** You've already paid to get them to your website once. Retargeting reach is significantly cheaper than acquiring new traffic. You're maximizing the investment you've already made.

## Strategic Remarketing Campaigns

We build retargeting campaigns that bring visitors back—with the right message, at the right time, through the right channel.

**Multi-platform reach.** Your ads follow them across Google Display Network, Facebook, Instagram, and more. Wherever they browse, they see your business.

**Segmented audiences.** Someone who visited your pricing page is more qualified than someone who bounced from the homepage. We segment audiences by behavior and serve different messages accordingly.

**Frequency management.** There's a line between being memorable and being annoying. We manage ad frequency to stay visible without becoming invasive.

**Sequential messaging.** Different messages for different stages. First reminder about your services. Then social proof and reviews. Then a special offer. The story unfolds over time.

## Don't Let Warm Leads Go Cold

You're spending money to drive traffic to your website. Some of that traffic will convert immediately. Most won't. But many of those visitors are still potential customers—they just need more time.

Retargeting bridges that gap. It keeps your business visible throughout the entire decision process, turning "maybe later" into "let's do this."
