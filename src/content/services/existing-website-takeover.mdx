## The Orphaned Website

The developer disappeared. The agency dissolved. The contractor ghosted. Your website exists—but you can't access it, can't update it, can't fix the problems accumulating daily.

You're locked out of your own digital property. Updates can't happen. Security vulnerabilities go unpatched. Changes require finding someone willing to untangle someone else's code. Every day, the situation gets worse.

Starting over seems wasteful. Continuing seems impossible. You're stuck with an asset that's becoming a liability.

## Why Website Transitions Fail

Taking over an existing website is harder than building new. Previous decisions—good and bad—are baked in. Documentation rarely exists. Knowledge walked out the door with whoever built it.

**Missing access credentials.** Hosting logins, domain registrars, email configurations—scattered across accounts and people who've moved on. Recovering access becomes archaeology.

**Undocumented customizations.** Code modifications nobody documented. Settings nobody remembers changing. Functionality that works for reasons nobody understands.

**Accumulated technical debt.** Years of quick fixes, workarounds, and temporary solutions that became permanent. Every change risks breaking something unexpected.

**Platform obsolescence.** Outdated systems that can't be updated without breaking. Security patches that aren't available. Technology that's aged out of support.

## Seamless Website Transition

We specialize in inheriting websites from previous developers—untangling problems, recovering access, and establishing proper management without starting from scratch.

**Access recovery.** Tracking down credentials, recovering accounts, establishing proper ownership. Getting you back in control of your digital property.

**Comprehensive audit.** Understanding what exists, what works, what doesn't. Documenting the current state so changes can be made safely.

**Stabilization and cleanup.** Fixing urgent issues, applying overdue updates, eliminating immediate risks. Getting the site to a stable baseline.

**Ongoing management.** Taking over continuous maintenance, updates, and improvements. Providing the support your site has been missing.

## Save the Investment

Rebuilding from scratch wastes everything invested in your current site—the SEO value, the content, the customizations, the time. Takeover preserves that investment while establishing proper management going forward.

Your website has value. It just needs someone to care for it properly.
