## Reviews Are Your New Resume

Before hiring a contractor, 93% of homeowners check online reviews. They're not just glancing—they're reading. Comparing. Deciding.

Your reviews are the most powerful sales tool you have. A strong review profile closes deals before you even pick up the phone. A weak one costs you jobs you'll never know you lost.

You do great work. Your customers are happy. But are they leaving reviews? Without a system, most satisfied customers never share their experience online—while one unhappy person will review you everywhere.

## The Review Gap

Most contractors have fewer reviews than they deserve—and it's costing them money.

**The silent majority problem.** Happy customers don't leave reviews by default. They need to be asked. They need it to be easy. Without a system, great work goes undocumented.

**The unhappy vocal minority.** Dissatisfied customers always leave reviews. Without a counterbalance of positive reviews, one negative experience can dominate your profile.

**The recency factor.** Old reviews lose weight. A profile with no recent reviews looks like a business that isn't active. Customers wonder what happened.

**Platform fragmentation.** Google, Facebook, Yelp, BBB, Angi, HomeAdvisor—reviews are scattered everywhere. Managing reputation means managing all of them.

## Building Your Review Engine

We help you systematically generate reviews from satisfied customers—while monitoring and managing your online reputation across platforms.

**Automated review requests.** After every completed job, automated messages ask for reviews at the perfect moment. High response rates because the process is easy and timely.

**Platform optimization.** We ensure your profiles are claimed, optimized, and up-to-date across all relevant platforms. Consistent information. Professional presentation.

**Monitoring and alerts.** Real-time monitoring catches reviews as they're posted—positive ones to share, negative ones to address. Nothing surprises you.

**Response management.** Professional, prompt responses to every review—thanking positive reviewers and addressing concerns from negative ones. How you respond matters as much as what they say.

## Your Reputation Is Your Most Valuable Asset

Reviews compound over time. Every five-star review makes the next customer more likely to call. Every call you close adds another potential reviewer. The flywheel builds.

The contractors with hundreds of five-star reviews didn't get lucky. They built systems that turn great work into visible proof.
