      <h3 class="h3 font-bold">From Solar Success to Roofing Dominance</h3>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        After building a successful solar business with our marketing system, we expanded into roofing. The transition made sense—same homeowners, same trust-building process, same need for quality leads. We took everything that worked in solar and adapted it for roofing. The results exceeded our expectations.
      </p>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Roofing has its own challenges: storm seasons that demand immediate response, insurance claims that require educated homeowners, off-seasons where the phone goes quiet. We've lived through all of it. When a hailstorm hits, we know how to capture those leads before competitors even wake up. When winter slows down, we know how to keep our name in front of prospects until spring.
      </p>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Storm damage, re-roofs, new construction, commercial flat roofs—we've marketed and closed jobs across every category. The funnels, the ads, the follow-up sequences—we built them for ourselves first. Now you can use the exact same system that keeps our roofing crews busy year-round.
