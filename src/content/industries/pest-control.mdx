      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        When someone finds roaches in their kitchen or a wasp nest by their front door, they're not price shopping—they want the problem gone immediately. These emergency calls are goldmines, but only if homeowners find you first. We make sure they do, with dominant local search presence and ads that capture urgent intent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        But the real value of emergency calls isn't the one-time treatment. It's the opportunity to convert panicked homeowners into quarterly service customers. We help you build the follow-up systems and marketing that turn every call into a potential subscription—multiplying the lifetime value of each customer.
      </p>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        From general pest control to specialized services like termite treatment, bed bug elimination, and wildlife removal—we help pest control companies attract customers across every service category. More emergency calls. More subscriptions. Predictable, growing revenue.
