## The Big Firms Are Outspending You 10 to 1

Every time someone in your area needs a lawyer, they pull out their phone and search. Personal injury. Family law. Estate planning. Criminal defense. **Who shows up first?**

The mega-firms with massive marketing budgets are dominating search results, running TV ads, and plastering billboards across town. They're signing clients that should be yours — clients in YOUR community who would be better served by a local attorney who actually cares.

**You went to law school to help people, not to lose clients to marketing machines.**

## Why Law Firm Marketing Requires Expertise

Legal marketing isn't like marketing a restaurant or retail store. The stakes are higher, the rules are stricter, and the competition is fierce:

- **Bar association compliance** — advertising rules vary by state and violation means discipline
- **High-intent searches** — people searching for lawyers have urgent, immediate needs
- **Trust barriers** — potential clients are skeptical and scared; they need reassurance
- **Case value variance** — a single case can be worth $5,000 or $5,000,000
- **Referral networks** — professional relationships drive significant business

## The Koi Crest Legal Marketing Advantage

We understand that every practice area has different client acquisition needs. A personal injury firm markets differently than an estate planning attorney.

- **High-intent SEO** — dominate searches like "personal injury lawyer [city]" and "divorce attorney near me"
- **Compliant PPC campaigns** — Google Ads that follow bar rules while maximizing case intake
- **Reputation building** — generate reviews and testimonials that build trust
- **Content authority** — educational content that positions you as the expert in your practice area
- **Lead qualification** — filter out tire-kickers and focus on cases worth your time

## Every Day You Wait, Cases Go to Your Competition

Right now, someone in your area is searching for exactly the legal help you provide. They're scared, confused, and need guidance. **Are they finding you?**

**Our law firm clients typically see a 50% increase in qualified consultations within 60 days.**
