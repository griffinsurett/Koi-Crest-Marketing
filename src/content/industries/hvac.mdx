      <h3 class="h3 font-bold">Capture Every Lead When Demand Spikes</h3>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        When the first heat wave hits or the first freeze arrives, every HVAC company in your area is competing for the same desperate homeowners. The companies that dominate local search and have their ads dialed in capture most of those leads. Everyone else fights over scraps. We make sure you're in the first group.
      </p>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        But seasonal spikes aren't enough to build a real business. The smart HVAC contractors focus on maintenance agreements—recurring revenue that smooths out the slow months and creates customers for life. We help you market those programs and convert one-time service calls into long-term relationships.
      </p>
      <p class="text-main text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        From emergency AC repair to complete system replacements, from furnace tune-ups to indoor air quality solutions—we help HVAC contractors get found for every service they offer. More visibility. More leads. More consistent revenue.
