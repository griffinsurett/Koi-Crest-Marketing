## Your Competitors Are Stealing Your Customers

Every day, homeowners in your area are searching for services you provide. They're typing "plumber near me," "best electrician in [your city]," and "emergency HVAC repair" into Google. **The question is: are they finding you or your competition?**

Most home service businesses rely on word-of-mouth and hope. Hope that past customers will remember them. Hope that the phone will ring. Hope that somehow, someway, new customers will appear.

**Hope isn't a marketing strategy.**

## Why Home Services Businesses Struggle Online

The home services industry faces unique challenges that generic marketing agencies don't understand:

- **High-ticket services** require trust before purchase — homeowners won't hire someone off a random ad
- **Local competition** is fierce, with established players dominating search results
- **Seasonal demand** creates feast-or-famine cash flow cycles
- **Review dependency** means one bad review can tank your business
- **Emergency services** need to appear instantly when customers are desperate
