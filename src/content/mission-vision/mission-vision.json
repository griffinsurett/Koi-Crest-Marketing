    "description": "Help home service contractors across the United States stop leaving money on the table. Founded by a veteran who built this system to grow his own roofing company, we're now sharing it with every plumber, electrician, HVAC tech, and landscaper nationwide who's tired of watching less-skilled competitors outmarket them."

    "description": "Be the nationwide marketing partner that contractors actually trust — because our founder is a veteran contractor himself. No agencies that 'specialize' in everything. No cookie-cutter campaigns. Just proven strategies from someone who knows what it's like to bid a job, close a deal, and make payroll."
